Introduction

This is version 2 of my Small Church Website. Version 1 was created in Project Code Phase 1 using only HTML and CSS. This version, version 2, retains most of the content from version 1 but now includes bootstrap, jquery and JavaScript coding as well as HTML and CSS. The website has a collapsing navigation bar, a jumbotron at the top and a footer at the bottom that will appear on each page, and is responsive to different screen sizes using the grid system and media queries.  

Navigation

The collapsing navigation bar includes links to the following pages:
•	Home 
•	About Us
•	Calendar/Events
•	Photo Gallery
•	Sermons
•	Giving
•	Contact Us

At the bottom of every page is a footer that includes the church’s contact information: location, phone number and email address which increases in size when the mouse hovers over it and a link to the church’s Facebook page. Not all of the pages will be used for all churches. At a minimum, sites will have Home, About Us, Contact and Giving pages. Pages such as sermons and a photo gallery are optional as there may be licensing and permission requirements.

Content

•	Home  - the home page provides information about ongoing services, what events are scheduled for the current week and a link to an external site to retrieve and read a daily bible verse.
•	About Us – the about us page has a dropdown menu to link to pages that provide information about the church, the pastor and the various church ministries.  In addition each of these pages provides the same ongoing services, what events are scheduled for the current week and the link to an external site to retrieve and read a daily bible verse that is found on the home page.
•	Calendar/Events – provides information of events that are scheduled to occur over the next three months as well as a link to a calendar pdf of the events tentatively scheduled for the entire year. The site visitor is informed that clicking the full calendar link will load a pdf file.
•	Photo Gallery – the photo gallery page contains a carousel of pictures, with left and right glyphicons, taken at the church or taken by church members who sent the pictures to me.
•	Sermons – the sermons page contains audios of the pastor’s sermons each captioned with the date and sermon title. It has not been determined how many sermons will be available. In addition, the page provides the same ongoing services and what events are scheduled for the current week that is found on the home page. The goal is the animate the section of the page containing the weekly events when the visitor’s mouse enters the section.
•	Giving – the giving page provides information on how to support the church by mail, in person or over the Internet via a third party link to PayPal to make monetary donations to the church.
•	Contact Us – the contact us page provides the church’s phone number, email address, and location with a third-party link to Google maps to obtain directions to the church. The page also presents a form for visitors to email questions or make a comment.

Summary

The website is created for a small church that wants an Internet presence to provide basic information about the church, its ministries and events, and to allow visitors to make monetary donations to the church via the Internet.  Although version 2 will be used as a template to create sites for small churches using their desired color schemes and content, the information and content is an actual church looking to upgrade their current website.  Adobe color picker was used to determine the colors best used with blue, the pastor’s favorite color. 

Because the site is still under construction, some of the pages and content are subject to change as my coding knowledge increases.
